# Microsoft 365 Tenant Migration Simulation — Case Study

**Project Owner:** Ayobamidele Aderosoye  
**Toolkit:** Dark👣 M365 Migration Simulation Kit  
**Date Completed:** July 2025

---

## 🚀 Objective
To simulate a complete Microsoft 365 tenant-to-tenant migration using a hands-on approach, custom PowerShell scripts, and Microsoft-provided tools. The goal was to prepare for real-world projects, freelancing, and enterprise migrations.

## 📈 Key Outcomes
- Full working simulation of M365 migration lifecycle
- Clean data migration of SharePoint List via GUI & PowerShell
- Created reusable script pack for future client jobs
- Built productized package for resale or GitHub exposure

---

## 📄 Lessons Learned
- Graph API and PnP PowerShell are powerful but need correct token/auth setup
- GUI fallback is essential when scripting fails (especially for SharePoint lists)
- Mailbox migration via PST is simple but not scalable
- Automating field creation from CSV saves massive time
